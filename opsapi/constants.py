"""
This file defines constant structures for which you can reference or inherit from.
Think HTTP codes, max open file descriptors, thats what I'd put in here.

This can be leveraged in the SDK, and by extension in the constants namespace
in any extension modules.

class BaseConstants:
    """
    Define any local constants you wish to use. Add member variables or structs
    like namespace limits, bitmasks, commonly (ab)used constructs, or whatever.
